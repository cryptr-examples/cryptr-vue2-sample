# Cryptr with Vue2

## 01 - Project setup

Start to create a new Vue2 app

```
vue create cryptr-vue2-sample
```

Couple of options are available, it depends mainly on your preferences, but you need to *add Router to handle protected routes*, & this tutorial is for *Vue2* (but Vue3 could work).

```
cd cryptr-vue2-sample
```
